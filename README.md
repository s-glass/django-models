# Lab - Class 27
## Project: Django Models

Author: Sarah Glass for Python 401
Worked at a Remo table with Anthony, Dan, Slava, and Jared.

## Overview

Django has a powerful Object Relational Mapper that allows us to persist data using Python instead of SQL.

Today youâ€™ll build out a project with one model and wire up that model using Django Views.

Many feature tasks for Model, Views, Templates, and User Acceptance Tests.
